Textures Extractor/Reinserter v1.0b6 by Vash -www.romhacking.it-

This tool will scan any file and look for Tim2/Tim3/Gim file(s). It also rips every image file it finds and it's also able to put them back into the original archive.

The main feature of this tool is that it can handle tim2/3 and gim archives, so that it allows you to find the images, edit them and reinsert everything in the blink of an eye.

-> TextER [option] [file] [type]

OPTION:

-e file [looks for and extract any TIM2/3 or GIM file]
-c file [insert the ripped textures back into the original file]

TYPE:

-tm [TIM2 & TIM3 (PS2)]
-gim [GIM (PSP)]
