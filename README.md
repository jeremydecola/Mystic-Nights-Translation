# Mystic Nights (PS2) English Translation 

Mystic Nights (미스틱 나이츠) is an obscure Korean-Exclusive survival horror Playstation 2 title.
It was developed by N-Log Corporation and published by Sony Computer Entertainment of Korea in 2005.
Although a North-American release was planned, Sony mysteriously pulled the plug.

Little is known about this game and it is extremely difficult to track down, even in Korea.
As a big fan of the survival horror genre, I took it upon myself to translate the title in hopes that it reaches a wider audience.

I hope you enjoy!
